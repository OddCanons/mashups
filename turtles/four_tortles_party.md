# Four Tortles Party

These characters use the standard D&D 5e rules, Xanathar's Guide to Everything for the Bard college, the [Artificer](https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/unearthed-arcana/artificer-revisited) preview from [Unearthed Arcana](https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/unearthed-arcana), and _[The Tortle Package](https://www.dndbeyond.com/marketplace/source/the-tortle-package)_ from [D&D Beyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/). This version of the tortles reflects their personalities and capabilities in class choices, instead of assuming four monks. Standard D&D weapons are used to represent the weapons you might expect these tortles to wield.
