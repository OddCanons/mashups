# Turtles all the way down

Sometimes you just want a solid team of turtles as your party, no matter the role playing system or setting. And you want them to have their own identities and weapons, no matter how similar they are. And you want them to be on the youngish side. And you want the number of them to be four. Rules for pizza are not included.
