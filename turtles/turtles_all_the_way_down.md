# Turtles all the way down

Sometimes you just want a solid team of turtles as your party, no matter the role playing system or setting. And you want them to have their own identities and weapons, no matter how similar they are. And you want them to be on the youngish side. And you want the number of them to be four. Rules for pizza are not included.

## ![Dungeons & Dragons 5e party](four_tortles_party.md)

This is a more balanced party of tortles with different classes to reflect their personalities.

## ![Mutant: Genlab Alpha](mutant_genlab_alpha.md)

Big, mutant turtles using the Year Zero Engine.

## ![Star Wars: Edge of the Empire](edge_of_the_empire.md)

If there are planets of squids and hammerheads out there, that galaxy has something like a turtle.

## Invitation
