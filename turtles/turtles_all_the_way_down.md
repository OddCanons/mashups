# Turtles all the way down

Sometimes you just want a solid team of turtles as your party, no matter the role playing system or setting. And you want them to have their own identities and weapons, no matter how similar they are. And you want them to be on the youngish side. And you want the number of them to be four. Rules for pizza are not included.

## [Dungeons & Dragons 5e monks](four_tortles.md)

This is a classic group of tortle monks with their own weapon choices. There are two versions. The Way of Shadow tortles are classic ninja types. The Way of the Kensei tortles make better use of their weapon choices.

## [Dungeons & Dragons 5e mixed party](four_tortles_party.md)

This is a more balanced party of tortles with different classes to reflect their personalities and interests. As a fighter, the leader can actually dual wield effectively, unlike either of the monk options.

## [Mutant: Genlab Alpha](mutant_genlab_alpha.md)

Big, mutant turtles using the Year Zero Engine.

## [Star Wars: Edge of the Empire](edge_of_the_empire.md)

If there are planets of squids and hammerheads out there, that galaxy has something like a turtle.

## [Star Wars: Force and Destiny](force_and_destiny.md)

You know you really wanted them to be Jedi. You really did. You were reading the Edge of the Empire version thinking, "Where are the lightsabers?" They're here.

## Invitation

As with other Odd Canon mashups and house rules, you are invited to submit your own groups of four turtles in your favorite game or setting or to submit edits to the groups already listed here.
