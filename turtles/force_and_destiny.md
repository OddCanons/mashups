# Star Wars: Force and Destiny

These rules assume you have the core rule book (FD), _Endless Vigil_ (EV), _Knights of Fate_ (KF), and _Edge of the Empire: Special Modifications_ (SM). In order to make these characters completely by the Star Wars RPG book, Testudians _count as_ **Southern Mustafarians** (SM). This gives them more of a desert turtle origin. For Testudians based more on pond turtles or aquatic turtles, replace the Southern Mustafarian special ability with a similar ability for another environment. The starting rank of Enduring makes sense for a carapace/shell. Testudians are native to Testudar, of course.

In addition to their starting XP for being a Testudian, each character has an additional 150 XP spent on improvements and 1 destiny point. This represents roughly six full sessions of prior play for the team. They are the crew of the freight-modified **** () Mind's Eye.

*For an official weapon, use the Lightwhip (EV 42) instead. The Lightchako is designed to be a shorter, single flail weapon that borrows some from a Shoto and some from a Lightwhip. They have Disorient when the wielder is using at least two Lightchako together.
