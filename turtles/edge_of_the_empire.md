# Star Wars: Edge of the Empire

These rules assume you have the core rule book (EE), _Fly Casual_ (FC), _Special Modifications_ (SM), and _No Disintegrations_ (ND). In order to make these characters completely by the book, Testudians _count as_ **Southern Mustafarians** (SM). This gives them more of a desert turtle origin. For Testudians based more on pond turtles or aquatic turtles, replace the Southern Mustafarian special ability with a similar ability for another environment. The starting rank of Enduring makes sense for a carapace/shell. Testudians are native to Testudar, of course.

In addition to their starting XP for being a Testudian, each character has an additional 150 XP spent on improvement and 1 destiny point. This represents roughly six full sessions of prior play for the team.
