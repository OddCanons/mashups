# Character Creation

Character creation follows a modified version of the Mutant: Elysium rules for creating an heir (ME 15-39). It should quickly become apparent clone troubleshooters are not as capable as Mutant: Elysium heirs.

## Steps

1. Choose your name. This may take a long time to get right. You can come back to it.
1. Choose your service group. This will map to a Mutant: Elysium profession. See the table below.
1. Roll for a mutation (MYZ 71) and (ONBB).
1. Distribute 12 attribute points.
1. Distribute 6 skill points.
1. Choose your talent.
1. Decide if your mutation is registered. Machine Empathy (ONBB) may not be registered. Your clones would be eliminated on sight.
1. Choose your secret society.
1. Your starting reputation within your secret society is 3, modified as follows:
    1. Apply the modifier for the profession to which your service group mapped.
    1. Apply -2 if your mutation is registered, except:
        1. -4, if you are part of an anti-mutant secret society (e.g. Anti-Mutant)
        1. +2, if your mutation is psionic in nature and you are a member of a pro-psionic secret society (e.g. Psion)
1. Choose your starting gear.

## Service Groups

Service groups map to professions in Mutant: Elysium. The table below is based on the 2nd Edition of Paranoia. Feel free to map service groups in other editions to Mutant: Elysium roles as makes sense for your planned missions.

| SERVICE GROUP | PROFESSION
| ------------- | ----------
| Internal Security | Investigator
| Technical Services | Technician
| HPD and Mind Control | Procurator
| The Armed Forces | Soldier
| PLC | Technician
| Power Services | Technician
| Research and Design | Scholar
| CPU | Officer

## Mutations

Each character has a mutation from the Mutant: Year Zero mutations list (MYZ 71) and starts with a single Mutation Point (MYZ 69). The player or GM may also create other mutations inspired by the edition of Paranoia used as source material or other sources. Mutations follow the rules from Mutant: Year Zero (MYZ 69-77).

Below are some additional mutations to round out the set in Mutant: Year Zero with a 2nd Edition Paranoia theme. In the spirit of Paranoia, they are not particularly balanced, but mostly align with the mechanics of Mutant: Year Zero mutations.

You can add them to the mutations list table (MYZ 71) as shown. The new mutations are described below.

| D66 | MUTATION
| --- | --------
| .. | ..

| 61 | Precognition
| 62 | Regeneration
| 63 | Spectral Vision
| 64 | Teleport

* Clairvoyance (ZC5 34)
* Cryokinesis (ZC2 5)
* Electric (ZC5 34)

# Paranoia Concepts

The mashup rules assume the use of the following concepts from the Paranoia world.

* **Color-Coded Clearance Levels**
* **The Computer**
* **Clones**
* **Experimental Equipment** handed out before missions
* **Standard Mission Structure**
  * Briefing
  * Optional visit to Production, Logistics, and Commissary for standard kit
  * Visit to Research and Design
  * One or more mission episodes
  * Wrap up / Debrief for survivors 
* **Mutations**, using Mutant: Year Zero mutations
* **Secret Societies** with secret missions
* **Service Groups** with secret missions
* **Traitors** and accusations

# Mutant: Elysium Rules to Modify or Ignore

* **Age** is not used. No one keeps track of how old they are.
* **Appearance** is not important, other than equipment worn or carried or treasonous mutations or obvious biomechatronics.
* **Big Dreams** are not used.
* **Critical Injuries** (ME 78) for rolls 62-66 are replaced with **Smoking Boots**: Lethal - - -
* **Double Agents** are not used. Every character has one or more secret missions and a mutation. Everyone is a traitor looking for other traitors.
* **Houses** are not used. Instead troubleshooters are members of service groups.
* **Misconduct** is replaced by the standard troubleshooter method of shooting traitors first and finding evidence later.
* **Patrol Leader** is usually called "Team Leader" and is assigned by some means in the mission briefing.
* **Relationships** are not used as described in Mutant: Elysium. Instead, characters will develop relationships through their service group and secrect society missions.
* **Reputation** is used in the context of the secret society.
* **Security Classes** are not used. Use Paranoia's color-coded clearance levels instead.
* **Zone Rot** is not used. There is no Zone Rot in Paranoia. There are plenty of hazards without zone rot. However, feel free to use the zone rot mechanics as part of a specific mission. Rot can also be used as the mechanic for exposure to radition from sources like leaking power plants, energy grenades, and tac nuke cone rifle shells.

# Other Rules

* Mutant: Year Zero Zone Compendium 2: Deep Blue Sea includes rules for conflict in the water, including water vehicles. (6-7)
