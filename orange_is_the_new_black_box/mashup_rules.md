# Character Creation

Character creation follows a modified version of the Mutant: Elysium rules for creating an heir (ME 15-39). It should quickly become apparent clone troubleshooters are not as capable as Mutant: Elysium heirs.

## Steps

1. Choose your name. This may take a long time to get right. You can come back to it.
1. Choose your service group. This will map to a Mutant: Elysium profession. See the table below.
1. Distribute 12 attribute points.
1. Distribute 6 skill points.
1. Choose your talent.
1. Roll for or choose a mutation (MYZ 71).
1. Decide if your mutation is registered. Machine Empathy (ONBB) may not be registered. Your clones would be eliminated on sight.
1. Choose your secret society.
1. Your starting reputation within your secret society is 3, modified as follows:
    1. Apply the modifier for the profession to which your service group mapped.
    1. Apply -2 if your mutation is registered, except:
        1. -4, if you are part of an anti-mutant secret society (e.g. Anti-Mutant)
        1. +2, if your mutation is mental in nature and you are a member of a pro psionic secret society (e.g. Psion)
1. Choose your starting gear.

## Service Groups

# Paranoia Concepts

The mashup rules assume the use of the following concepts from the Paranoia world.

* **Color-Coded Clearance Levels**
* **The Computer**
* **Clones**
* **Experimental Equipment** handed out before missions
* **Standard Mission Structure**
  * Briefing
  * Optional visit to Production, Logistics, and Commissary for standard kit
  * Visit to Research and Design
  * One or more mission episodes
  * Wrap up / Debrief for survivors 
* **Mutations**, using Mutant: Year Zero mutations
* **Secret Societies** with secret missions
* **Service Groups** with secret missions
* **Traitors** and accusations

# Mutant: Elysium Rules to Modify or Ignore

* **Age** is not used. No one keeps track of how old they are.
* **Appearance** is not important, other than equipment worn or carried or treasonous mutations or biomechatronics.
* **Big Dreams** are not used.
* **Double Agents** are not used. Every character has one or more secret missions and a mutation. Everyone is a traitor looking for other traitors.
* **Houses** are not used. Instead troubleshooters are members of service groups.
* **Misconduct** is replaced by the standard troubleshooter method of shooting traitors first and finding evidence later.
* **Patrol Leader** is usually called "Team Leader" and is assigned by some means in the mission briefing.
* **Relationships** are not used as described in Mutant: Elysium. Instead, characters will develop relationships through their service group and secrect society missions.
* **Reputation** is used in the context of the secret society.
* **Security Class** are not used. Use Paranoia's color-coded clearance levels instead.
* **Zone Rot** is not used. There is no Zone Rot in Paranoia.
