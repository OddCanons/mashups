# Orange is the New Black Box



## Mashing Up

The original edition of [Paranoia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranoia_(role-playing_game)) was groundbreaking in background and tone, but the rules were clunky. The second edition featured cleaner rules, but lost its way thematically as supplements came out. Later editions have been hit or miss in tone and in attempts to incorporate more modern role playing game mechanics, with none of the more recent editions landing them together. Then [Modiphius](https://www.modiphius.com/) published [Mutant: Elysium](https://www.modiphius.net/collections/mutant-year-zero/products/mutant-elysium). Elysium is built on the streamlined [Mutant: Year Zero](https://www.modiphius.net/collections/mutant-year-zero) (MYZ) role play engine that also powers [Tales from the Loop](https://www.modiphius.net/products/tales-from-the-loop-rpg-rulebook) and [Coriolis](https://www.modiphius.net/products/coriolis-the-third-horizon-core-rule-book?_pos=22&_sid=84ea74f0b&_ss=r). MYZ games have rules for mutants and [robots](https://www.modiphius.net/collections/mutant-year-zero/products/mutant-mechatron)) (and [anthropomorphic animal characters](https://www.modiphius.net/products/mutant-genlab-alpha-core-book-print-pdf)). Elysium is a great dystopian game in its own right and Paranoia.
