## Mashing Up

The original edition of [Paranoia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranoia_(role-playing_game)) was groundbreaking in background and tone, but the rules were clunky. The second edition featured cleaner rules, but lost its way thematically as the publisher released world-breaking supplements. Later editions have been hit or miss in tone and in attempts to incorporate more modern role playing game mechanics, with none of the more recent editions landing both together. Then [Modiphius](https://www.modiphius.com/) published [Mutant: Elysium](https://www.modiphius.net/collections/mutant-year-zero/products/mutant-elysium). Elysium is built on the streamlined [Mutant: Year Zero](https://www.modiphius.net/collections/mutant-year-zero) (MYZ) role play engine that also powers [Tales from the Loop](https://www.modiphius.net/products/tales-from-the-loop-rpg-rulebook) and [Coriolis](https://www.modiphius.net/products/coriolis-the-third-horizon-core-rule-book?_pos=22&_sid=84ea74f0b&_ss=r). MYZ games have rules for mutants and [robots](https://www.modiphius.net/collections/mutant-year-zero/products/mutant-mechatron)) (and [anthropomorphic animal characters](https://www.modiphius.net/products/mutant-genlab-alpha-core-book-print-pdf)). Elysium is a great dystopian game in its own right. It includes security classes, families, and investigator roles that aren't that far off from the color coding, secret societies, and service groups in Paranoia.

This mashup adventure assumes the reader is familiar with the Paranoia setting and has access to at least one Paranoia core rule book that covers the service groups and secret societies mentioned in the game. Concepts like troubleshooter naming conventions, clones, and the Computer are not explained here.
